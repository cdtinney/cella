## summary

Cella is a web application for displaying, running, and editing cellular automata. Cellular automata are 1 to N dimensional grids of cells that consist of states, coupled with a set of rules describing how the states of the cells should behave depending on the states of surrounding cells. Our project has limited package dependicies - only express (node.js web application framework) and MongoDB (NoSQL document database) are used. Express is used to serve static web pages in combination with plain JavaScript code for running, editing, loading, and saving cellular automta. MongoDB is used to store user-made configurations and rule sets.
