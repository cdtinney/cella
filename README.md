cella
=============

Our web application will be an online system for creating and viewing cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life.  Preset configurations and rule sets for the cellular automata will be stored in the backend database which the web server will provide to the client along with a JavaScript application capable of running the various CAs. The client will run and display the CAs and act as an editor for both configurations and rules, and will be able to request the server to store modifications in the database. However, this would be heavy on the client-side - the server could instead run the CA and send the output to be displayed by the client.
